# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. The goal was to get an idea and understand the fundamentals on how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript works and use the basis of them to build a website. Learning how to code involves a lot of practice and trial and error. It takes more than just reading about how to code. Creating this website gives students a starting point on practicing before starting boot camp. When classes start and students learn about key elements, it won't be completely foreign since they have already been introduced to some of the concepts. This project allowed students to perform tasks that any developer would need to do such as creating branches to transfer into GitHub and debugging any mistakes that were made.
